1.  Introduction

   Once a DNS zone's master file exists on the primary server, there are
   standards-compliant ways to automate the distribution of that zone to
   secondary servers in [RFC9432] DNS Catalog Zones.  Further, there are
   standards-compliant ways to alter the contents of the zone in
   [RFC2136] Dynamic Updates.

   However there is no standards-compliant method of initialising a new
   master file for the zone, ready for such operations.

   Various DNS software products have proprietary mechanisms for
   acheiving this, some requiring that the zone master file is somehow
   populated first on the primary servers' filesystem.

   However, there is no standards-compliant vendor-independent mechanism
   of signalling to the primary server that a new file is to be created
   for the zone and populated with basic minimal initial zone data.

   Operators of large scale DNS systems may want to be able to signal
   the creation of a new file for a new zone without wanting to be tied
   to a particular vendor's proprietary software.  Further, they may
   want to avoid the need or overhead of engineering a bespoke solution
   with the ongoing need to support and maintain it.

   Having dynamically provisioned a new zone on the primary server, the
   operator may then manage resource records in the zone via Dynamic
   Updates [RFC2136].  In this scenario, they may also want to
   distribute the zones to secondary servers via DNS Catalog Zones
   [RFC9432].

   The scope of this document is therefore confined to the initial
   provisioning of the zone file on the primary server, and optional
   signalling of initial DNSSEC policy or configuration (see
   Appendix B.2).

   Broader provisioning of the base nameserver configuration is beyond
   the scope of this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following is in addition to the conventions and definitions as
   defined in [RFC9432].

   Within DNS servers, specifically when transferring zones to other
   servers, there is the concept of a primary server and a secondary
   server in each transfer relationship.

   Each secondary server will be transferring the zone from a configured
   upstream primary server, which may, itself, be a secondary server to
   a further upstream primary server, and so on.

   However, within this document, the term "primary server" is used
   specifically to mean the primary server at the root of the AXFR/IXFR
   dependency graph.  This server is where the resource records that
   form the zone's content are maintained in the master file.  Thus,
   that server does not transfer the zone from another server.

   The term "master file" is as per the description in Section 5 of
   [RFC1035], noting that some software products offer data stores for
   the master file that are not an actual file on a filesystem, such as
   a database.

   The use of parenthesis in the examples is as described in Section 5.1
   of [RFC1035].

3.  Catalog Properties

   If initialisation of the underlying master file for the member zone
   is not required or is disabled in configuration, then the various
   init properties defined in this document MAY be absent, and in that
   context, their absence DOES NOT constitute a broken catalog zone.

   However, if the initialisation of the underlying master file for the
   member zone is enabled, and the properties and parameters defined
   below constitute a broken configuration as defined in this document,
   then the catalog is broken, and MUST NOT be processed (Section 5.1
   [RFC9432]).

3.1.  Zone File Initialisation (init property)

   When suitable configuration is activated in the implementation, and a
   new member zone entry is added to the catalog being served by the
   primary server, the primary server SHOULD create the underlying
   master file for the zone with the properties and parameters outlined
   in the init property.

   The init property is the parent label to the other labels that
   facilitate the adding of the various properties and parameters.

   The implementation may permit the following on a global, or per
   catalog basis, by way of suitable configuration parameters:

   *  The master file is ONLY created for the zone if the master file
      does not already exist

   *  The master file is NEVER created (effectively, the initialisation
      capability is disabled for this catalog or primary server, and the
      master file would be expected to exist as is the case before this
      document)

   *  The master file is ALWAYS created, overwriting any existing master
      file for the zone

   The second of the above options can facilitate the initialisation of
   a downstream signer configuration without necessarily being used to
   signal the initial state of the zone's master file on the primary
   server.

   A number of sub-properties, expressed as labels within the bailiwick
   of the "init" label, define the initialisation parameters.

3.2.  Start Of Authority (soa property)

   The soa property is used to specify the SOA that will be applied to
   the created zone file for the member zone.

   There MUST be one and ONLY one soa property record with the exception
   that a member zone record can be specified to override the default
   (see Section 4 below).

   Multiple soa property records within a given scope constitutes a
   broken catalog zone.

   Absence of a soa property similarly constitues a broken catalog zone.

3.2.1.  Parameters

   With the exception of the serial number, the SOA record parameters
   are supplied as key=value pairs in the RDATA of a TXT resource
   record, with the pairs separated by whitespace.

   The keys are as per the field names expected in a SOA record as
   defined in Section 3.3.13 of [RFC1035].  The values supplied MUST be
   compliant with the definitions therein.

3.2.2.  Example

   soa.init.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "mname=<mname> rname=<rname> "
         "refresh=<refresh> retry=<retry> expire=<expire> "
         "minimum=<minimum>" )

3.3.  Nameservers (ns property)

   Actual NS records cannot be used, as we do not want to actually
   delegate outside of this catalog zone.

   The nameserver parameters are supplied as key=value pairs in the
   RDATA of a TXT resource record, with the pairs separated by
   whitespace.

   If the nameservers are in-bailiwick and address records are therefore
   required, suitable address records MUST be created in the member
   zone's master file from the parameters specified.

   If the nameservers are in-bailiwick of a zone in the catalog, and an
   address is not specified, this would result in a zone that will not
   load; This denotes a broken catalog zone.

   There MUST be at least one ns property record that can be applied to
   a member zone, either specified directly as per Section 4 or in the
   catalog section to be inherited.

   Therefore, a catalog zone that contains no nameserver entries
   constitutes a broken catalog zone.

   The ns property can be specified multiple times, with one nameserver
   specified per entry.

3.3.1.  name Parameter

   The "name" parameter MUST be present, and contains the name of the
   nameserver as it should appear in the zone's master file.  To avoid
   ambiguity in behaviour, this SHOULD be a fully qualified and dot-
   terminated name.

   The value of the "name" parameter MUST be compliant with
   Section 3.3.11 of [RFC1035].

   An ns property record that does not contain a "name" parameter
   consistutes a broken catalog zone.

3.3.2.  ipv4 and ipv6 Parameters

   The "ipv4" and "ipv6" parameters are OPTIONAL.  They contain the IP
   address(es) of the hostname specified in the "name" parameter.

   If the value in the "name" parameter is in-bailwick, and hence
   requires that the relevant address enties are also created in the
   zone, at least one of either the "ipv4" or "ipv6" parameters MUST be
   specified.

   The value of the "ipv4" parameter, if present, MUST be a valid IPv4
   address, compliant with Section 3.4.1 of [RFC1035].

   The value of the "ipv6" parameter, if present, MUST be a valid IPv6
   address, compliant with Section 2.1 of [RFC3596].

   An ns property record that contains an in-bailiwick name, but does
   not contain at least one address parameter constitutes a broken
   catalog zone.

3.3.3.  Example

   ns.init.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "name=some.name.server. "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.1 ipv6=2001:db8::1" )
   ns.init.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "name=another.name.server. "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.129 ipv6=2001:db8:44::1" )

3.4.  DNSSEC (dnssec Property)

   Placeholder for definition of how to signal to a zone's signer(s)
   that we wish to initialise keys and sign the newly created zone...

4.  Member Zone Properties

   The default properties outlined above can be overridden on a per
   member zone basis.  Where per member zone entries are specified in
   the catalog, they MUST be used in preference to the default
   properties specified at the catalog level.

   A subset MAY be specified here; for example, the SOA could be omitted
   here and just the NS records or DNSSEC parameters specified, with the
   omitted properties inherited from the catalog level values.

   <unique-N>.zones.$CATZ          0 PTR example.com.
   soa.init.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "mname=<mname> "
         "rname=<rname> refresh=<refresh> retry=<retry> "
         "expire=<expire> minimum=<minimum>" )
   ns.init.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ  0 TXT ( "name=some.name.server. "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.1 ipv6=2001:db8::1" )

4.1.  Change Of Ownership (coo Property)

   There is no change to the coo property; if the member zone changes
   ownership to another catalog, fundamentally, the zone's master file
   already exists.

   The scope of this document is solely concerned with the
   initialisation of a new zone's master file, and so in the case of the
   zone changing ownership, the initialisation parameters MUST NOT be
   processed.

5.  Name Server Behaviour

5.1.  General Behaviour

   The parameters specified in the init property will contain hostnames,
   for example in the NS records and in the SOA; these will be
   replicated verbatim into the zone upon creation, and so it should be
   noted that if they would be fully qualified in a manually created
   master file for the zone, they MUST be fully quallified in the
   parameter specification in the property.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the security considerations outlined in
   [RFC9432].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the registry:

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Catalog Zone Example

   The following is an example catalog zone showing the additional
   properties and parameters as outlined in this document.

   There are defaults specified for the SOA and NS records, which would
   be used by the example.com. zone.

   The example.net. zone would utilise the default SOA record, but would
   utilise the more specific NS records.

   The default nameservers are in-bailiwick of example.com, which is in
   the catalog, and so the address record details are supplied in order
   to facilitate the addition of the address records.

Appendix B.  Author Notes/Thoughts

   _NB: To be removed by the RFC Editor prior to publication._

   The term "Primary Master" (Section 1 [RFC2136] is not applicable as
   the primary server noted in this document likely is NOT listed in the
   MNAME or NS.

B.1.  Is catalog zones the right place for this?

   Much consideration has been given as to whether the primary server
   should be consuming the/a catalog zone, rather than simply serving it
   to secondary servers for consumption.

   It does feel a little bit like it muddies the waters between zone
   distribution and zone "provisioning" but:

   1.  In a catalog zone scenario, the catalog equally feels like the
       place for zone related parameters

   2.  It feels less like Dynamic Updates would be the right place for
       it, for example.

   3.  An API for _just_ zone initialisation feels like a big thing that
       would likely be overkill, and probably not get implemented, and
       would likely be a part of a wider implementation's general
       nameserver configuration and operations API, which is waaaaay
       beyond the scope of this document, and possibly beyond
       standardisation.

   It may be considered that this is "nameserver configuration",
   however, it has strong parallels in this regard to the
   "configuration" on secondary servers, including such considerations
   as to which entities are allowed to notify and/or transfer the zone,
   as are conveyed to those secondary servers in [RFC9432] DNS Catalog
   Zones.  Indeed, much of the same configuration may be needed by or
   shared with the primary server for those same zones.

   Implementing via an extension of catalog zones feels like it closes
   the gap in the end-to-end ecosystem whereby catalog zones + dynamic
   updates gives an end-to-end approach to the creation of a zone, its
   underlying master file, distribution of that zone to secondary
   servers, and the ongoing manipulation of records in the zone.

   TODO - add more detail explaining the above, reasoning, etc...?

B.2.  DNSSEC

   It seems that it'd be useful to signal initial policy/settings for
   DNSSEC in a standardised way also, but the primary might, or might
   not be the signer; the signer may be downstream.  But it might be
   very nice to be able to signal to the signer that it should create
   some keys, sign the zone...

   15/11 - Knot acheives this by use of the group property, setting the
   RDATA of the group record for a member zone to the name of a pre-
   defined template name.  However, this appears to assume that the
   primary server is also the signer, which may not be the case.
   Further reading required to see if this would facilitate a downstream
   (knot) server signing in-line.

B.3.   Properties

B.3.1.   General

   Should the properties be listed in the registry as "soa.init" and
   "ns.init", given "init" itself is a placeholder label, and does not
   (currently?) take any parameters or records of its own?

   TODO: Do we need to signal the initial TTL of the records being added
   (SOA, NS, A, AAAA)... I think so... Could specifiy with an extra
   key=value pair, or could leave it to pick up from the SOA

B.3.2.  coo Property

   Are there any considerations around change of ownership that need
   mentioning or documenting here...?

   14/11 - section added to address this; is there anything else that
   needs clarifying or covering?

B.3.3.  soa Property

   Consideration was given as to whether things like SOA parameters
   should be individual records, but it seemed unnecessary to break them
   out and create the additional records.

   Should we permit the property to be made up of multiple TXT records
   so long as a given parameter is not repeated?

   Should we specify a SOA serial format? or an initial soa serial
   value...? If not, should we specify in the text, or leave it to the
   implemention, which may have a default, such as BIND's "serial-
   update-method"

   Given that it is pretty much expected that the operator is going to
   start making changes to the zone via dynamic updates, it'd be
   reasonable to expect them to be able to set those parameters.  Which
   does beg the question, do we need to specify soa and nameserver
   values at all, or just specify that the zone file is or is not to be
   created, and fill some template default values with the expectation
