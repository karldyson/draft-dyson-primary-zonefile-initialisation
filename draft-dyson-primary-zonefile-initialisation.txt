1.  Introduction

   Once a DNS zone's master file exists on the primary server, there is
   a standard way to automate the distribution of that zone to secondary
   servers defined in "DNS Catalog Zones" ([RFC9432]).  Further, there
   is a standard way to dynamically alter the contents of a zone defined
   in "Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)"
   ([RFC2136]).

   However there is no standards-defined method of initialising a new
   master file for the zone, ready for such operations.

   Various DNS software products have proprietary mechanisms for
   achieving this, some requiring that the zone master file is somehow
   pre-populated on the primary servers' filesystem.

   Operators of large scale DNS systems may want to be able to signal
   the creation of a new file for a new zone without wanting to be tied
   to a particular vendor's proprietary software.  Further, they may
   want to avoid the need or overhead of engineering a bespoke solution
   with the ongoing need to support and maintain it.

   Having dynamically provisioned a new zone on the primary server, the
   operator may then manage resource records in the zone via DNS Dynamic
   Updates ([RFC2136]).  In this scenario, they may also want to
   distribute the zones to secondary servers via DNS Catalog Zones
   ([RFC9432]).

   This document defines a vendor-independent mechanism of signalling to
   the primary server that a new file is to be created for the zone and
   populated with basic minimal initial zone data.

   The scope of this document is confined to the initial provisioning of
   the zone file on the primary server, and optional signalling of
   initial DNSSEC policy or configuration (see Appendix B.2).

   Broader provisioning of the base nameserver configuration is beyond
   the scope of this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following is in addition to the conventions and definitions as
   defined in DNS Catalog Zones ([RFC9432]).

   The use of parenthesis in the examples is as described in [RFC1035]
   Section 5.1.

2.1.  Primary Server

   Within DNS servers, specifically when transferring zones to other
   servers, there is the concept of a primary server and a secondary
   server in each transfer relationship.

   Each secondary server will be transferring the zone from a configured
   upstream primary server, which may, itself, be a secondary server to
   a further upstream primary server, and so on.

   However, within this document, the term "primary server" is used
   specifically to mean the primary server at the root of the AXFR/IXFR
   dependency graph.  This server is where the resource records that
   form the zone's content are maintained in the master file.  Thus,
   that server does not transfer the zone from another server.

2.2.  Master File

   The term "master file" is as per the description in [RFC1035]
   Section 5, noting that some software products offer data stores for
   the master file that are not an actual file on a filesystem, such as
   a database.

3.  Catalog Zone Properties

   This section specifies new Catalog Zone level properties, additional
   to those defined in DNS Catalog Zones ([RFC9432]).

   If initialisation of the underlying master file for the member zone
   is not required or is disabled in an implementation's configuration,
   then the various initialisation properties defined in this document
   MAY be absent, and in that context, their absence DOES NOT constitute
   a broken catalog zone.

   However, if the initialisation of the underlying master file for the
   member zone is enabled, and the properties and parameters defined
   below constitute a broken configuration as defined in this document,
   then the catalog is broken, and MUST NOT be processed (DNS Catalog
   Zones Section 5.1 ([RFC9432])).

3.1.  Schema Version (version property)

   For this memo, the value of the version.$CATZ TXT resource record
   MUST be set to "3".

3.1.1.  Example

   version.$CATZ 0 IN TXT "3"

3.2.  Zone File Initialisation (init property)

   When suitable configuration is activated in the implementation, and a
   new member zone entry is added to the catalog, the primary server
   MUST create the underlying master file for the zone using the values
   of the properties and parameters outlined in the init property.

   It is not necessary for the catalog zone's primary server to be the
   member zone's primary server, however, the same server MUST be the
   primary server for all member zones within a given catalog zone.

   The implementation may permit the following on a global, or per
   catalog basis, by way of suitable configuration parameters:

   *  The master file is ONLY created for the zone if the master file
      does not already exist

   *  The master file is NEVER created (effectively, the initialisation
      capability is disabled for this catalog or primary server, and the
      master file would be expected to exist as is the case before this
      document)

   *  The master file is ALWAYS created when a new zone is added to the
      catalog zone, overwriting any existing master file for the zone

   The second of the above options can facilitate the initialisation of
   a downstream signer configuration without necessarily being used to
   signal the initial state of the zone's master file on the primary
   server.

   A number of sub-properties, expressed as labels within the bailiwick
   of the "init" label, define the initialisation parameters.

3.3.  Start Of Authority (soa property)

   The soa property is used to specify the SOA that will be applied to
   the created zone file for the member zone.

   There MUST be one and ONLY one soa property record defined in a given
   scope.

   Multiple soa property records within a given scope constitutes a
   broken catalog zone.

   See the Section 4 for clarity on scope inheritance.

   Absence of a soa property similarly constitutes a broken catalog
   zone.

3.3.1.  Parameters

   With the exception of the serial number, the SOA record parameters
   are supplied as three character-string values in the RDATA of a TXT
   resource record.

   The first being the MNAME value, the second being the RNAME value,
   and the third containing the numeric timer values in decimal in the
   same order as expected in an SOA resource record, as defined in
   [RFC1035] Section 3.3.13.

   All three MUST be present.

   The MNAME and RNAME MUST be fully qualified, however a terminal @
   label can be supplied to indicate the member zone's name.  In this
   case, the @ label MUST be substituted with the member zone's name at
   zone file creation.  See also Section 5.1.

3.3.2.  Example

   soa.init.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "<mname>" "<rname>"
         "<refresh> <retry> <expire> <minimum>" )

3.4.  Nameservers (ns property)

   Actual NS records cannot be used, as we do not want to actually
   delegate outside of this catalog zone.

   The nameserver parameters are supplied as key=value pairs in the
   RDATA of a TXT resource record, with the pairs separated by
   whitespace.

   If the nameservers are in-bailiwick and address records are therefore
   required, suitable address records MUST be created in the member
   zone's master file from the parameters specified.

   If the nameservers are in-bailiwick of a zone in the catalog, and an
   address is not specified, this would result in a zone that will not
   load - this denotes a broken catalog zone.

   There MUST be at least one ns property record that can be applied to
   a member zone, either specified directly as per Section 4 or in the
   catalog section to be inherited.

   Therefore, a catalog zone that contains no nameserver entries
   applicable to a given member zone constitutes a broken catalog zone.

   The ns property can be specified multiple times, with one nameserver
   specified per entry.

3.4.1.  name Parameter

   The "name" parameter MUST be present, and contains the hostname of
   the nameserver as it is intended to appear in the corresponding NS
   record's RDATA in the zone's master file.  See Section 5.1.

   The value of the "name" parameter MUST be compliant with [RFC1035]
   Section 3.3.11.

   An ns property record that does not contain a "name" parameter
   consistutes a broken catalog zone.

3.4.2.  ipv4 and ipv6 Parameters

   The "ipv4" and "ipv6" parameters are OPTIONAL.  They contain the IP
   address(es) of the hostname specified in the "name" parameter.

   If the value in the "name" parameter is in-bailwick, and hence
   requires that the relevant address enties are also created in the
   zone, at least one of either the "ipv4" or "ipv6" parameters MUST be
   specified.

   The value of the "ipv4" parameter, if present, MUST be a valid IPv4
   address, compliant with [RFC1035] Section 3.4.1.

   The value of the "ipv6" parameter, if present, MUST be a valid IPv6
   address, compliant with [RFC3596] Section 2.1 and SHOULD use the
   representation from [RFC5952] Section 4.

   An ns property record that contains an in-bailiwick name, but does
   not contain at least one address parameter constitutes a broken
   catalog zone.

   Only records within the member zone are within the scope of this
   document; if the primary server is also coincidentally the primary
   server for a member zone's parent, regardless of whether the parent
   zone is also a member zone, it is the responsibility of the parent
   zone's administrator to ensure the delegation and any required glue
   resource records are present in the parent zone.

3.4.3.  Example

   ns.init.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "name=some.name.server."
         "ipv4=192.0.2.1 ipv6=2001:db8::1" )
   ns.init.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "name=another.name.server."
         "ipv4=192.0.2.129 ipv6=2001:db8:44::1" )

3.5.  DNSSEC (dnssec property)

   Placeholder for definition of how to signal to a zone's signer(s)
   that we wish to initialise keys and sign the newly created zone,
   noting that the signer may be further downstream consuming the
   catalog, and thus not necessarily the member zone's primary server.

   If the catalog zone consumer is configured to be a signer of the
   member zone being processed, the server SHOULD apply the policy in
   the catalog.  This action does not have to be constrained to the
   point at which a member zone is newly added to the catalog zone.  If
   a server is re-configured such that signing is added to the
   configuration for a given catalog zone, it SHOULD apply the policy to
   existing members zones within the catalog.

   If the server consuming the catalog zone is not configured to be a
   signer for the member zones in the catalog, records within the
   bailwick of the dnssec property record MUST be ignored.

   The dnssec property is OPTIONAL and if absent then no special
   processing relating to DNSSEC should occur.

3.5.1.  Enabling Signing (enabled property)

   The enabled property is used to signal whether zones should be
   signed.  Because this can be configured at both the catalog zone
   level, as well as at the member zone level, it facilitates the
   ability to, for example, set policy parameters at the catalog level,
   disable signing at the catalog level, and then enable signing on a
   per member zone level.  In this example, the signed member zones
   would pick up the policy from the catalog level.

3.5.1.1.  Parameters

   The only parameter is a boolean, stored as a character-string in the
   RDATA of a TXT resource record.

3.5.1.2.  Examples

   enabled.dnssec.init.$CATZ IN TXT "0"

3.5.2.  Policy (policy property)

   If the implementation has the concept of pre-configured DNSSEC
   policy, the policy property csan be used to indicate the name of a
   configured policy.

   If the policy property if configured, then key property records MUST
   be ignored.

   If the policy is not configured on the designated signing server,
   then an error SHOULD be logged.  Processing SHOULD continue as if the
   entire dnssec property section was absent.

3.5.2.1.  Example

   policy.dnssec.init.$CATZ IN TXT "some-dnssec-policy-name"

3.5.3.  Keys (key property)

   The key property is used to configure keys that will be applied to
   the member zone(s) in the catalog.

   In the case of a single combined key (type csk), at least one key
   MUST be configured.

   In the case of split keys (types zsk, ksk), at least one key of each
   type MUST be configured.

3.5.3.1.  type parameter

   The type parameter MUST be present, and is used to convey the key
   type, and MUST be one of csk, zsk or ksk

3.5.3.2.  alg parameter

   The alg parameter MUST be present, and is used to convey the key
   algorithm.

3.5.3.3.  bits parameter

   The bits parameter is OPTIONAL, depending on whether this is relevant
   to the algorithm being used.

3.5.3.4.  lifetime parameter

   The lifetime parameter is OPTIONAL and is used to specify how long
   the key should be published for before being rolled.

   A value of zero (0) is used to indicate "unlimited" whereby the key
   will not be rolled.  This is also the default if unspecified.

3.5.3.5.  Example

   Combined Key

key.dnskey.init.$CATZ IN TXT "type=csk alg=RSASHA256 bits=2048 lifetime=0"

   Split Key

key.dnssec.init.$CATZ IN TXT "type=ksk alg=ECDSAP256SHA256"
key.dnssec.init.$CATZ IN TXT "type=zsk alg=ECDSAP256SHA256 lifetime=90D"

4.  Member Zone Properties

   The default properties outlined above can be overridden per member
   zone.  If properties are specified in a more specific scope than the
   defaults, the most specific scope MUST be used.

   A subset MAY be specified in a more specific scope, for example, the
   SOA could be omitted, and just the NS records or DNSSEC parameters
   specified.

   The omitted properties would be inherited from the catalog level
   values.

   <unique-N>.zones.$CATZ          0 PTR example.com.
   soa.init.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ 0 TXT ( "<mname>"
         "<rname>" "<refresh> <retry> <expire> <minimum>" )
   ns.init.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ  0 TXT ( "name=some.name.server. "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.1 ipv6=2001:db8::1" )
   enabled.dnssec.<unique-N>.zones.$CATZ IN TXT "1"

4.1.  Change Of Ownership (coo property)

   There is no change to the coo property; if the member zone changes
   ownership to another catalog, fundamentally, the zone's master file
   already exists.

   The scope of this document is solely concerned with the
   initialisation of a new zone's master file, and so in the case of the
   zone changing ownership, the initialisation parameters MUST NOT be
   processed.

   Noting that the primary server for a given catalog's member zones may
   not be the primary server for the catalog zone itself, nor the
   primary server for another catalog's member zones, operators should
   consider their implementation's configuration when planning a change
   of ownership operation.

5.  Name Server Behaviour

5.1.  General Behaviour

   Some of the parameters specified in the initialisation properties
   contain domain-name values as defined in [RFC1035] Section 3.3, for
   example in the NS records and in the SOA.  These will be used to
   specify values in the corresponding resource records in the member
   zone's file.  The domain-name values MUST be fully qualified in the
   parameter specification in the property.  A terminal @ label MUST be
   substituted by the member zone name at the point of zone file
   creation.

5.2.  Member Zone Removal

   If the member zone is removed from the catalog zone, then the zone's
   master file MUST be removed.

5.3.  Zone-Associated State Reset

   In the event of a zone state reset being carried out, the state of
   the zone's master file SHOULD be reset as if the file was being
   initialised for the first time per this document.

6.  Implementation and Operational Notes

   When configuring the use of catalog zones, implementations should
   give the operator the ability to indicate whether the catalog zone
   consumer is a primary or secondary for a given catalog's member
   zones, along with whether the consumer is a signer of the zone.

   A given consumer MAY be any combination of primary, secondary,
   primary+signer or secondary+signer, but of course cannot be both
   primary _and_ secondary.

   It is not mandatory that the primary server for a given catalog zone
   is also the primary server for the catalog's member zones.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the security considerations outlined in
   DNS Catalog Zones ([RFC9432]).

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Catalog Zone Example

   The following is an example catalog zone showing the additional
   properties and parameters as outlined in this document.

   There are defaults specified for the SOA and NS records, which would
   be used by the example.com. zone.

   The example.net. zone would utilise the default SOA record, but would
   utilise the more specific NS records.

   The default nameservers are in-bailiwick of example.com, which is in
   the catalog, and so the address record details are supplied in order
   to facilitate the addition of the address records.

   catz.invalid.                   0 SOA invalid. invalid. (
         1 3600 600 2419200 3600 )
   catz.invalid.                   0 NS invalid.
   soa.init.catz.invalid.          0 TXT ( "ns1.example.com."
         "hostmaster.example.com." "14400 900 2419200 3600" )
   ns.init.catz.invalid.           0 TXT ( "name=ns1.example.com. "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.1 ipv6=2001:db8::1" )
   ns.init.catz.invalid.           0 TXT ( "name=ns2.example.com. "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.2 ipv6=2001:db8::2" )
   kahdkh6f.zones.catz.invalid.    0 PTR example.com.
   hajhsjha.zones.catz.invalid.    0 PTR example.net.
   ns.hajhsjha.zones.catz.invalid. 0 TXT "name=ns1.example.com"
   ns.hajhsjha.zones.catz.invalid. 0 TXT ( "name=ns1.example.net "
         "ipv4=192.0.2.250 ipv6=2001:db8:ff::149" )

A.2.  example.com Master File Example

   This is the resulting zonefile for example.com as initilised from the
   above catalog zone example.

   example.com.     3600 SOA ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                              1 14400 900 2419200 3600 )
   example.com.     3600 NS   ns1.example.com.
   example.com.     3600 NS   ns2.example.com.
   ns1.example.com. 3600 A    192.0.2.1
   ns1.example.com. 3600 AAAA 2001:db8::1
   ns2.example.com. 3600 A    192.0.2.2
   ns2.example.com. 3600 AAAA 2001:db8::2

A.3.  example.net Master File Example

   This is the resulting zonefile for example.net as initilised from the
   above catalog zone example.

   example.net.     3600 SOA ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                               1 14400 900 2419200 3600 )
   example.net.     3600 NS   ns1.example.com.
   example.net.     3600 NS   ns1.example.net.
   ns1.example.net. 3600 A    192.0.2.250
   ns1.example.net. 3600 AAAA 2001:db8:ff::149

Appendix B.  Author Notes/Thoughts

   _NB: To be removed by the RFC Editor prior to publication._

   The term "Primary Master" (DNS Dynamic Updates Section 1 ([RFC2136])
   is not applicable as the primary server noted in this document likely
   is NOT listed in the MNAME or NS.

B.1.  Is catalog zones the right place for this?

   Much consideration has been given as to whether the primary server
   should be consuming the/a catalog zone, rather than simply serving it
   to secondary servers for consumption.

   It does feel a little bit like it muddies the waters between zone
   distribution and zone "provisioning" but:

   1.  In a catalog zone scenario, the catalog equally feels like the
       place for zone related parameters

   2.  It feels less like Dynamic Updates would be the right place for
       it, for example; Dynamic Updates has specific purpose around
       updating existing zones, which seems further removed from this
       functionality.

   3.  An API for _just_ zone initialisation feels like a big thing that
       would likely be overkill, and probably not get implemented, and
       would likely be a part of a wider implementation's general
       nameserver configuration and operations API, which is waaaaay
       beyond the scope of this document, and possibly beyond
       standardisation.

   It may be considered that this is "nameserver configuration",
   however, it has strong parallels in this regard to the
   "configuration" on secondary servers, including such considerations
   as to which entities are allowed to notify and/or transfer the zone,
   as are conveyed to those secondary servers in [RFC9432] DNS Catalog
   Zones.  Indeed, much of the same configuration may be needed by or
   shared with the primary server for those same zones.

   Implementing via an extension of catalog zones feels like it closes
   the gap in the end-to-end ecosystem whereby catalog zones + dynamic
   updates gives an end-to-end approach to the creation of a zone, its
   underlying master file, distribution of that zone to secondary
   servers, and the ongoing manipulation of records in the zone.

   TODO - add more detail explaining the above, reasoning, etc...?

B.2.  DNSSEC

   It seems that it'd be useful to signal initial policy/settings for
   DNSSEC in a standardised way also, but the primary might, or might
   not be the signer; the signer may be downstream.  But it might be
   very nice to be able to signal to the signer that it should create
   some keys, sign the zone...

   15/11 - Knot acheives this by use of the group property, setting the
   RDATA of the group record for a member zone to the name of a pre-
   defined template name.  However, this appears to assume that the
   primary server is also the signer, which may not be the case.
   Further reading required to see if this would facilitate a downstream
   (knot) server signing in-line.

B.3.   Properties

B.3.1.   General

   Should the properties be listed in the registry as "soa.init" and
   "ns.init", given "init" itself is a placeholder label, and does not
   (currently?) take any parameters or records of its own?

   TODO: Do we need to signal the initial TTL of the records being added
   (SOA, NS, A, AAAA)... I think so... Could specifiy with an extra
   key=value pair, or could leave it to pick up from the SOA

   3.1 line 98 - I'm specifying the implementation's configuration here,
   and it's outside of the scope of this document to specify how an
   implementation names its config parameters, etc, surely?

   Do we even need to supply these properties?  The reason an operator
   would be doing this would be because they want to create a zonefile
   with standard tooling and then immediatly commence making dynamic
   updates to the zone.  An implementation could simply drop in basic
   SOA and NS with the expectation being that the operator then
   _replaces_ them.

B.3.2.  coo Property

   Are there any considerations around change of ownership that need
   mentioning or documenting here...?

   14/11 - section added to address this; is there anything else that
   needs clarifying or covering?

B.3.3.  soa Property

   Consideration was given as to whether things like SOA parameters
   should be individual records, but it seemed unnecessary to break them
   out and create the additional records.

   Should we permit the property to be made up of multiple TXT records
   so long as a given parameter is not repeated?

   Should we specify a SOA serial format? or an initial soa serial
   value...? If not, should we specify in the text, or leave it to the
   implemention, which may have a default, such as BIND's "serial-
   update-method"

   Given that it is pretty much expected that the operator is going to
   start making changes to the zone via dynamic updates, it'd be
   reasonable to expect them to be able to set those parameters.  Which
   does beg the question, do we need to specify soa and nameserver
   values at all, or just specify that the zone file is or is not to be
   created, and fill some template default values with the expectation
   that the operator would immediatly overwrite them with "correct"
   values...?

B.3.4.  ns Property

   Is there a circular dependency or race condition issue here...?

   Do we need to consider the possibility of multiple IP addresses for a
   nameserver name?  If so, maybe ipv4=192.0.2.1,192.0.2.2
